      <p>Nominating Committee Needs</p>

      <p>Please note: The synod has gone away from having some terms last 6 years, such as Board of Appeals. Now all positions will be a uniform 4-year term length. A 12-year maximum remains. Some who are now serving a current 6-year term may be relected in 2022, 2024 or 2026 to a second, 4-year term, but will be ineligible for a third term, because they would then serve more than 12 years. We will adjust our nominations accordingly this year.</p>

      <p><strong>Board of Appeals</strong></p>

      <p>Rev. Roger Rockhoff was appointed to a term that ends in June 2022 and is eligible to be nominated. A second nominee would still be needed if Roger is willing to be renominated.</p>

      <p>Mr. Frederick Pfotenhauer is not eligible for another term, so there will be no lay incumbent. Two lay nominees needed.</p>

      <p><strong>District Nominating Committee</strong></p>

      <p>The District Nominating Committee will need a new chairman. Rev. Henry Koch is completing his final term in June. Two nominees are needed. This position has been held by a pastor.</p>

      <p>The District Council nominates the representatives for the nominating committee from each conference, though the nominating committee has traditionally offered assistance.</p>

      <p>Rev. Keith Bilitz of Mankato Conference is retiring. Two nominees from that conference are needed.</p>

      <p>Rev. Paul Marggraf of Crow River is eligible to be renominated. A second nominee would be needed.</p>

      <p>Rev. Timothy Rosenow of St. Croix completes his appointment in June and is eligible to be nominated. A second nominee from the St. Croix conference would still be needed.</p>

      <p>For the Iowa circuit of the Southern Conference, Rev. Roger Neumann’s second term ends in June, and he is eligible to be renominated. A second nominee would be needed.</p>

      <p><strong>Mission Board</strong></p>

      <p><strong> Two Laymen needed (4 nominees)</strong></p>

      <p>One of the Mission Board’s lay representatives, David Sauer, completes his final term in June. Two nominees are needed (no lay incumbent). The term for one other layman, Daryl Schulz, is also ending, but he can be renominated. If he is willing to be nominated, a second nominee would still be needed for that ballot. </p>

      <p><strong>Synodical Council</strong></p>

      <p><strong>One Layman needed (3 nominees)</strong></p>

      <p>Mr. Kurt Sames’s first term ends in June. He is eligible to be renominated. Three total nominees are needed.</p>

      <p><strong>Martin Luther College Governing Board</strong></p>

      <p>A male teacher is needed for election to this board. Three nominees needed.</p>

      <p><strong>Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary Governing Board</strong></p>

      <p>A layman will be elected to this board. Three nominees are needed.</p>
